I research Dreamcast games primarily, I have been looking at Rez for a long time now...  
I keep notes and I am researching Rez build 836 in Ghidra, so when I have time I will be keeping my notes on here so they are accessible to whoever wants them. Uploading them will be slow because I have to format them properly.  
  
If you are interested in the Rez research I will be putting it all [here](rez.md).
