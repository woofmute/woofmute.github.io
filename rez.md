# Rez Research
i am not writing a proper readme rn. this is a page that can link to the other research notes when they exist in their places.

this will be worked on as i work on it. i make no promises as to how fast that will be, or whether i stay focussed on the same thing all the time. uploading as i go for my own benefit.
